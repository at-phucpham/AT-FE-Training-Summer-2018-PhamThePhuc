    <h3>Question 1:  What are the differences between a variable that is: 'null', 'undefined'?</h3>
    <p><b>Answer:</b> Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
      Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.
      Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined. JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically. </p>

    <h3>Question 2:  What is 'use strict'? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?</h3>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p>"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
    Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors. It is only declared at the beginning of a function/script.Strict mode will help save developers from errors they didn’t even know that existed in their code.</p>
    <p>Advantages:</p>
    <p>   - It will catch common coding errors, which will throw exceptions.</p>
    <p>   - When vulnerable actions are performed, it throws errors.</p>
    <p>   - It will show,let us know and disable the features that are poorly coded.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages::</p>
    <p>   -  It will not allow us to use the “with” statement. This statement will causes security and performance problems.</p>
    <p>   - It will not allow us to use the “arguments.caller” property, due to security concernsWe do not have an alternate to this property, but we can hard code an additional parameter.</p>

    <h3>Question 3:  What are the differences between '==' and '==='? Write an example for each case (if any)?</h3>
    <p><b>Answer: </b></p>
    <p>'==': it only compare value.</p>
    <p>'===': it compare value and type.</p>
    <pre>
    -Example:
      "abc" == new String("abc")    // true
      "abc" === new String("abc")   // false
    </pre>
  </div>

    <h3>Question 4: </h3>
    <p><b>Answer: </b></p>
    <p>'var':  The variable statement declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
    <p>'const':  is constant, variable won’t be reassigned.</p>
    <p>'let':  'let' appeared in ES6, it not exist ES5 to before, it declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value</p>
